In a series of posts I am going to attempt to describe The Ultimate Quality Engineer[ing department], and the standard we should all be shooting for.

The value of a Quality Assurance department has become an increasingly polarizing opinion for software development companies. One company decides the value just isn't there, while another can't wait to get one.

It feels like Quality departments are similar to the ocean tides on the beach; the tide rolls in (QA is added), and eventually receeds (QA is removed).

Can a Quality department really be that ephemeral? Are we, as Quality Assurance folks, subject to the will of the Moon and the Tides without any control of our future? Are we just grains of sand flowing in an out on the company's private beach?

Perhaps.

Or is it the case that the value demonstrated to "the powers that be" just isn't that consistent, or too narrow of a band to really make a lasting impact?

Let's list off some of the things a Quality Assurance Engineer (QAE) may perform (in no particular order & generalize to include the widest group possible):

- Manual Testing
- Exploratory Testing
- Checking the Acceptance Criteria (i.e. checking someone's work is actually complete)
- Running Automted test suites and processing those results
- Coordinating with other QAEs on test plans and release dates
- Writing bug reports and asking for rework
- Coordinating with Product on feature expectations

That's.... it? Surely there is more to our job than just clicking around and checking other engineer's work. No wonder we get the Axe before any other department.

For some companies, the role may encompass more responsibilites. Others may have fewer.

I am fortunate enough to work in a privilaged environment, where we have full access to every step of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). I hear of some QAE that don't even have access to the code. And I am not talking about pulling down from the remote repo and running code locally. I'm talking about not even being able to view Pull Requests with the details of the changes. What!? How can you be expected to assure quality when you don't even understand the scope of the changes? Are we really supposed to assume that a list of Accceptance Criteria (AC) on a Trello Card, Jira Ticket, etc... is going to encompass all the set of things that need to be checked as well as the potential risk to each change? NO WAY JOSE! An AC could represent a 1-line change, or it could be a 32 files changed and 1000 line diff. We. Need. To. Know. That.

How is it these QAE actually do their job well? It takes a lot of communication (if that's even allowed/possible) and a lot of back and forth. That is precious time you don't get back, and your cycle time for getting work from start to shipped just went wayyy up. Why do companies introduce these barriers? Is it a control thing? Compliance or regulatory issues?

Reading code and digesting what the change set represents and the associated risk is a huge part of what a QAE should be doing.
